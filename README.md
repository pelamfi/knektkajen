# Project Knektkajen

## Project status

So far there is nothing here. Just trying out various web technologies
and getting the feel for them.

## Prepare for building project

The npx is used to run bsb locally, but npx still needs to be installed globally
This however reduces chances of using wrong bsb versions.

```sh
npm install -g npx 
```

## Run Project

```sh
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run webpack
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run webpack` step), open up `build/index.html` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever `.re` file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.

**For more elaborate ReasonReact examples**, please see https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example

## Run Project with Server

To run with the webpack development server run 

    npm run server
    
and view in the browser at:

  * http://localhost:8000.
  
Running in this environment provides hot reloading and support for routing; just edit and save the file and the browser will automatically refresh.

Note that any hot reload on a route will fall back to the root (`/`), so `ReasonReact.Router.dangerouslyGetInitialUrl` will likely be needed alongside the `ReasonReact.Router.watchUrl` logic to handle routing correctly on hot reload refreshes or simply opening the app at a URL that is not the root.

To use a port other than 8000 set the `PORT` environment variable (`PORT=8080 npm run server`).

## Build for Production

```sh
npm run clean
npm run build
npm run webpack:production
```

This will replace the development artifact `build/Index.js` for an optimized version as well as copy `src/index.html` into `build/`. You can then deploy the contents of the `build` directory (`index.html` and `Index.js`).

If you make use of routing (via `ReasonReact.Router` or similar logic) ensure that server-side routing handles your routes or that 404's are directed back to `index.html` (which is how the dev server is set up).

**To enable dead code elimination**, change `bsconfig.json`'s `package-specs` `module` from `"commonjs"` to `"es6"`. Then re-run the above 2 commands. This will allow Webpack to remove unused code.

## Background
I'm learning web technologies and playing with an idea of having a
web based game to learn basic music theory or maybe just some kind of
musical toy.

### Various musical theoretical concepts with numerical values

Following concepts could be considered roughly equivalent in some mathematical
sense, but have different (although related) notations and conventions:

  * Interval as a number of half steps (eg. +5 half steps)
  * Note names as half steps in an octave (eg. F is 5 half steps above C)
  * Interval names (eg. Perfect fourth is 5 half steps)
  * Half steps between keys on a piano keyboard (eg. in ‚ïø‚îÇC‚ïø‚ïø‚îÇF‚ïø‚ïø‚ïø‚îÇ the F is 5 half steps above C )
  * Vertical positions on musical scores üéº
    * In treble (G clef ùÑû)
    * In bass (F clef ùÑ¢)
    * in the presence of sharps ‚ôØ and flats ‚ô≠
  * Intervals as closest fractional frequency multipliers (eg. the Perfect fourth multiplies requency by about 4/3)
  * Solf√®ge syllables (fixed) (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si)
  * Solf√®ge syllables (movable) (do=0, re=+2, mi=+4, fa=+5, sol=+7, la=+9, ti=+11)

### The idea about the game
The ultimate goal of the game would be to in a fun and rewarding way teach the following:
  * Read several kinds of musical notations for intervals and notes
  * Do musical "calculations"
  * Translate between numerical representations of various music theoretical concepts
  * Visualize some concepts from music theory in the minds eye
  * Do all the above quickly and without using any tools or tables

I recognize that just one item from above list would be a worthy
goal for a hobby / learning project, but I don't think it hurts to have
lofty goals as well as learning is the goal and even a tiny bit of
success is considered worth celebrating.
