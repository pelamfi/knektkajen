# Project Knektkajen

## Project status

So far there is nothing here. Just trying out various web technologies
and getting the feel for them.

## Background

I'm learning web technologies and playing with an idea of having a
nice web based game to learn basic music theory.

The ultimate goal of the game would be to in a fun and rewarding way teach the following:
  * Read all kinds of musical notations
  * Do musical "calculations"
  * Translate between numerical representations of various music theoretical concepts
  * Visualize some concepts from music theory in the minds eye
  * Do all the above  quickly and without using any tools or tables

I recognize that just one item from above list would be a worthy
goal for a hobby / learning project, but I don't think it hurts to have
lofty goals as well as learning is the goal and even a tiny bit of
success is considered worth celebrating.
