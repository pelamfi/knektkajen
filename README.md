Quoth [Yarn docs](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable):

  Homebrew
  You can install Yarn through the Homebrew package manager. This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

  brew install yarn
  If you use nvm or similar, you should ensure that your PATH lists nvmâ€™s shims before the version of Node.js installed by Homebrew.
