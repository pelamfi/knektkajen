## Installing yarn notes
I'm not sure whether Npm or Yarn is better for this project or
whether it makes any difference.

Here are some notes from me installing Yarn on my mac:

Quoth [Yarn docs](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable):

  Homebrew
  You can install Yarn through the Homebrew package manager. This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

  brew install yarn
  If you use nvm or similar, you should ensure that your PATH lists nvmâ€™s shims before the version of Node.js installed by Homebrew.
